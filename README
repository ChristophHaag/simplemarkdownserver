Simple script to get markdown content on the web

Create directories as categories in the directory the main.py script is in

Put markdown formatted .txt files inside those category directories
The filename (minus .txt) will be the title of the entry
The "modified" date of the file will be displayed in the category view and at the top of an entry view
